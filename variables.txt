// Homework Assignment #2: Variables and Constants

// what is hoisting?

/*
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. Inevitably, this means that no matter where functions and variables are declared, 
they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of whether their scope is global or local
*/


// What are the differences between let, const and var?

/* 
var can be reasigned and change type, it is a container for values. 
var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped.
A scope is always created when curly brackets are encountered. 
If we create a function, for example, a new scope is created:
The var keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.

// local var
function sayName(){
	var myName = "Anthony";
	console.log("My name is" +"" + myName)
}
sayName()
sayName()


// global var
var myName = "Anthony";

function sayName(){
	
	console.log("My name is" +"" + myName)
}
sayName()
console.log("My name is" +"" + myName)


//  let can be only available inside the scope it's declared,

function sayName(){
	let myName = "Anthony";
	console.log("My name is" +"" + myName)
}
sayName()
console.log("My name is" +"" + myName)



// comparing var and let
if (true) {
  var myName = "Anthony";
  let myMusic = "Afro hip hop";

  console.log(myName); // " Anthony";
  console.log(myMusic); // "Afro hip hop";
  
}

console.log(myName); // "Anthony";
console.log(myMusic); // ReferenceError: myMusic is not defined



/* 
Constants are block-scoped, much like variables defined using the let statement. 
The value of a constant can't be changed through reassignment, and it can't be redeclared.

*/

function sayName(){
	const myName = "Anthony";
	console.log("My name is" +"" + myName)
}
sayName()
console.log("My name is" +"" + myName)


// comparing var, let and const

if (true) {
  var myName = "Anthony";
  let myMusic = "Afro hip hop";
  const MyFood = "Fried Rice with beef";

  console.log(myName); // " Anthony";
  console.log(myMusic); // "Afro hip hop";
  console.log(myFood); // "Fried Rice with beef";
}

console.log(myName); // "Anthony";
console.log(myMusic); // ReferenceError: myMusic is not defined
console.log(myFood); // ReferenceError: food is not defined
